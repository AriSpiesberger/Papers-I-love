* ### A Tutorial Introduction to the Minimum Description Length Principle
  - This is an excellent paper that provides the information theoretic ideas behind model fitting. Formalism from a perspective that isnt noted much from a mathematical background, but is remarkably intuitive.

If you dont have some background in information theory, Reza- An Introduction to Information Theory is a great book

  A few very compelling ideas. This paper reflects on the information theoretic ideas behind model fitting, i.e. compression. It should be noted that nearly all statistical models can be considered in this way. Instead of considering the loss of a model, this defines well a more complete idea...that is the complexity of a model given the data, which essentially represents the complexity of a model, and its representation output.

  Complexity theory (2.2) makes an important but obvious case, that in the sense of representations, there is a very sparse special subset of data that can actually be compressed. Most data cannot be. Thus these representation spaces we consider should be noteably special. One should keep this in mind during model creation.
